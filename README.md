# Node-Js-Snippets
Node JS codes (using npm) to make some fun stuff

- Hero VS Villian <br>
  Used the 'superheroes' & 'supervillians' npms to get a random hero and villian name -- then simulated a fight between them & generated a random winner. Also, each piece of text appears on the console after a certain period of time - done to make it seem more interactive & fun.
